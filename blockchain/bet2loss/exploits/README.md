## solution1(intended)

One bug in the code to view logs. Use it to get sealer's private key and seal token to yourself.

## soluton2(intended-after-verification)

pre-calculate the answer in the constructor function and call bet is OK for win once for one address.

call constructor by `CREATE2` to depoly the contract and the call `selfdestruct` to suicide for multi times is OK for win enough for one address.

the BetToken in this directory is a older version, about it's abi is OK.

## solution3(unintended)

tkmk found the output speed of blocks is constant, so block.timestamp is predictable.
